# Task_3_result

#Task

The task is to build model that predicts a target based on the proposed features.
We have 53 anonymized features and a target column(internship_train.csv)
We need to provide predictions for internship_hidden_test.csv file.

#Explanation

The main idea was to find most important colomns for target prediction. But as you can see in Jupyter_analisis.ipynb, I found not only the colomns that matter, but also how from those colomns make a target. So I did not need to build a prediction model based on sklearn or evaluate it using the RMSE metric (100% accuracy because it's a formula for the "target" column)
